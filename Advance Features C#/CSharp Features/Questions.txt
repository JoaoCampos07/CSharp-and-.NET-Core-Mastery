What is a delegate ? 
R: A deleaget is a object that knows how to call a method (or a group of methods). 
Or a delegate is a reference or a pointer, to a function.

Why do we need delegates ? 
R: We can call methods directly, why do we want a delegate that is responsible to call methods for us. 
Well, this technique allow us to create applications that are extensible and flexible. Often is used to design frameworks.

Why delegates are usefull ? 
R: Delegates are useful to offer to the user of your objects some ability to customize their behavior. Most of the time,
you can use other ways to achieve the same purpose and I do not believe you can ever be forced to create delegates. 
It is just the easiest way in some situations to get the thing done.
